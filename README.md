# My Beginning Step for Success

**Welcome to my coding journey in a mysterious realm!**  
I suddenly found myself in a realm full of new challenges and topics, like Java. Normally, Java is best practiced on a laptop, but I didn’t have one. I didn’t even know the language of this realm!  

Instead of giving up, I crafted my own setup using a tablet with Termux and Javadroid. I worked hard, experimented, and learned a lot. Now, I have several projects to show for it.  

The lesson I learned: never be discouraged by what you don’t have. Be satisfied with what you do have, just like me—as a first-year student taking my first steps in the coding world.  

## My Quests (Projects)
- **HelloWorldAndBasics.java** – My first adventure into Java, learning the basics of syntax, printing output, and understanding how programs work.  
- **DiceGame.java** – A simple dice game where I honed loops and conditionals, testing my logic and strategy skills.  
- **MarksCalculator.java** – A marks calculator that introduced me to arrays and handling user input like a coding mage handling spells.  

## Skills Leveled Up
- Java fundamentals: loops, conditionals, arrays  
- Problem-solving and logical thinking  
- Building small games and calculators from scratch  

## How to Embark on These Quests
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open the `.java` file in a Java IDE (like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code).  
3. Compile and run the program.  

## My Goal
These projects mark my first steps in the coding world. I am continuously learning and planning to embark on more challenging quests to master programming.
